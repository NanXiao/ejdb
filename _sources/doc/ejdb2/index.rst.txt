EJDB2 Roadmap
=============

* Get rid of the Tokyocabinet. TC is an awesome software but nowadays it has many hard to fix :ref:`limitations <tc_limitations>`.
* Use highly concurrent `B+Tree` index structure with support of `MVCC`. I have thoughts how to implement it with some
  ideas from `LMDB <http://symas.com/mdb/>`_ copy-on-write btree and `B-link` trees.
* Review usage of `BSON` data format as the internal representation of documents. Considering more compact formats: `MessagePack <http://msgpack.org/>`_,
  `Smile <http://wiki.fasterxml.com/SmileFormatSpec>`_, `UBJSON <http://ubjson.org/>`_, `CBOR <http://cbor.io/>`_
